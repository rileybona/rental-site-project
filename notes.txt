getting started
    - go into Kanban cards (oops make them)
    - take the first card, figure out how to achieve the acceptance criteria
    - mostly an endpoint in your code


spots -
    - pause. create a table. create a model. create some seed data.


Testing
    - test early and often. Every few lines of code.
